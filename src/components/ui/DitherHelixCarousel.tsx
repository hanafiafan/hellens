// A spiral column of work that breaks up into print grain as it travels away
// from the viewer.
//
// No card is a flat rectangle. The vertex stage maps each one onto the surface
// of the cylinder it orbits, so the outer edges retreat in depth while the
// middle stays square to the camera, and the extremities trail behind the
// centre while the column is turning.
//
// It is built as a pipeline rather than an overlay:
//
//   cards -> colour + channel data -> four axial blurs -> resolve -> screen
//
// One progression value drives every stage of it, taken as the larger of two
// measurements: how close a pixel sits to the top or bottom border, and how far
// back into the spiral it lies. The smear dominates the first half of that
// progression and retreats as the grain claims the second, so the pair reads as
// one continuous process instead of two treatments layered together.
//
// The grain itself is an ordered threshold matrix evaluated against a
// three-point tone scale whose outer stops are both the page colour, sampled at
// the centre of each cell so the cell fills evenly. With both ends of the scale
// equal, the extremes of the range coincide and only a middle band departs
// from the page - which is why the result prints as texture rather than as
// flat posterisation.
